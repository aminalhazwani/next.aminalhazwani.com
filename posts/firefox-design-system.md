## Problem statement

With the growing number of Firefox products the team felt the need to consolidate shared design decisions under one roof. 

## Desired business objective

The design system initiative started to shape up during a major Firefox makeover –known as Photon– and the goal for our team was to document, test, share, and distribute design decisions across the whole organisation.

## Measure of success

During the course of our work we set different quarterly metric to measure our progress. Might be the number of components documentation, or the ratio of recently update components in stable Firefox version or the adoption of our Sketch library.

## Context

The Firefox design and engineering teams were our fist target audience but down the line we also understood how our contribution could support the whole open-source community like third-party add-ons developers. 

## Constraints 

We started with a group of design-only people with a couple of UX engineers available as necessary. During the course of the project we realised that this was a big limitation but we were not able to make any new hire so we created an ambassador program where with the help of external advocates we promoted our work across different disciplines and departments. 

Prior to the formation of our group there have been 2 other design system initiative that started and stopped after a while. Unfortunately previous these members left the company and we couldn’t ask them about what happed during those two iterations.

## Discovery

We run different analysis on the state of the art. For example we completed a component inventory that showcased all the different nuances of colours, typography, icons, patterns, and components. We interviewed designers and engineers to learn how they approached their work, from ideation to delivery. We tried to identify all the possibile opportunities where our project could support and better enable their work.
