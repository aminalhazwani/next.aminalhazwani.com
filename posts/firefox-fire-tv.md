## Problem statement

The goal of this major redesign was to provide watchers with a stronger TV-like experience. The first browser version was design and developed in a 5-day sprint and after shipping minor features the overall experience needed a bigger overhaul.

## Desired business objective

The initial version of the browser targeted Fire TV watchers that wanted to visit YouTube on the Amazon’s device. Google had recently removed their YouTube pp from the Amazon’s store and users could not access the website in other ways. 

This redesign wanted to build on top of the initial release and further explore how Firefox on a TV device could be more than a “YouTube player”. 

## Context

There was no existing qualitative research, and the quantitative data available –coming from users who allowed telemetry– was quite small due to the reduced number of feature and views available in Firefox.

In order to have a better understanding of the existing experience I stared to read through the app reviews posted on the Amazon’s store and I searched on subreddits about Firefox for the Fire TV.

## Constraints

During this redesign there were several constraints that had to be considered. First of all, this was a browser app that you would control only with a remote. We would ship voice feature down the road but that’s another story. Secondly the interface had to be visible from any feet away, in unknown lighting conditions. Moreover the TV could be placed in different rooms and that meant different contexts and situations. You could use your TV while being in bed, or while resting on  sofa, or while eating your breakfast. Finally the TV is probably one of the few technology gadgets that is used by the whole household.

## Discovery

I first started to explore how existing TV platform had approached TV UI. I then moved over the best rated apps on the respective store. Everything was new to me and had to understand how to translate my expertise to a different medium. 

## Ideation 

After I collect potential design approached and best practice I sketched out possibile new UIs. While sketching I tried to let my proposals adaptable to potential new content. We were setting the ground base for a TV design system that could support the scale and evolution of the app.

This is where I tested the design ideas with different content, strings, and layouts. I even invented potential new feature just to be sure that the new comports could be future-proof.

## Delivery

During the ideation phase I made sure to keep the whole team up to date and involved. Together we understood what was doable, what required too much effort, what was hard to accomplish due to the older Android version –Fire OS was based out of Android 5.1 while Android 9 was already widely available–, or what we could postpone for a future release.

We also discussed and explored how we could slowly and incrementally roll out the new components so that we could bring home new learnings while developing the next features.

## Impact 

Release after release we closely monitored people feedback, we wanted to make sure to intentionally addressed their needs. Redesigning the whole UI with a remote-first mindset proved to be the way to go and Firefox for Fire TV quickly grew up to 8 million users by the end of 2018.
