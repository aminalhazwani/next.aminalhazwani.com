description:
- paragraph: As the sole designer, I shaped from concept to shipping the first-ever voice-controlled Firefox Browser. Available on Amazon smart displays, it’s used by 800K+ users.
- paragraph: I navigated in uncharted territories where the rules and engagements weren’t established yet. I set the vision for the user experience and partnered with researchers, product managers, and engineers to champion customer needs. Finally, I created detailed interactive prototypes demonstrating flows, interactions, and animations.
